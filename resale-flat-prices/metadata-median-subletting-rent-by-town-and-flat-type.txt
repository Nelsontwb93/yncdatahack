Description:
  - 'Median Subletting Rent by Town, Flat Type Per Quarter. The data is based on rents
    self-declared in the subletting application forms. Nevertheless, it serves as
    a useful reference in sublet flat hunting. The median rent indicates that half
    the total number of units were rented above that price while half were below.'

  - '* The figures are based on rent declared in the subletting application forms
    and rounded off to the nearest $10'
